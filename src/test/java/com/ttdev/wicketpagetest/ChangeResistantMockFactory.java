/**
 * In unit tests, typically we need to create a mock object implementing a one
 * or two methods only of a certain interface. As we don't care about the other
 * methods, a dummy implementation (e.g., throwing an "unsupported" exception)
 * is enough for them. However, manually defining all such boring methods is no
 * good: on one hand, it is just noise in the code; on the other hand, if new
 * methods are added to the interface, the code will break.
 * 
 * To avoid these problems, you can define a class implement those methods
 * concerned only, then use this class to generate a sub-class of it at runtime
 * to implement all the rest abstract methods and create an instance for you.
 * <p>
 * In addition, it is assumed that the your class (and thus the sub-class
 * generated) is an inner class of an outer class (your unit test class) so the
 * instance will have access to the outer instance.
 * <p>
 * See {@link ChangeResistantMockFactoryTest} for how to use.
